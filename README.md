# MMM-3Day-Forecast
![3 day forecast](3day.png "3 day forecast.") OR ![3 day forecast](3-day2.png "3 day forecast.")

This a module for the [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/develop).  This module shows a 3 day forecast (today, tomorrow and the day after) using the Wunderground API. It displays the overall weather condition, highest temperature, likely-hood of rain, average humidity, highest windspeed and its direction forecast.  This is designed to compliment the [MMM-Weather-Now](https://github.com/nigel-daniels/MMM-Weather-Now) module.<br>  
**Note:** The Weather company has ceased the free API that this module was based on, as a result this is now based on the API offered by [BitWeather](https://www.weatherbit.io). If you are updating to this version then please don't forget to update your config too!

## Installation
1. Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute `git clone https://github.com/nigel-daniels/MMM-3Day-Forecast`.  A new folder `MMM-3Day-Forecast` will appear, navigate into it.
2. Execute `npm install` to install the node dependencies.

The entry in `config.js` can include the following options:

## Notes
I hope you like this module, I know it duplicates many other weather modules, however I missed my home-brew mirrors weather information so I recreated it for MM2.  Feel free to submit pull requests or post issues and I'll do my best to respond.
